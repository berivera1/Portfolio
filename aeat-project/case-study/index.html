                    <h2>The Overview</h2>
                    <p>For the course IDM 232: Scripting for Interactive Digital Media II, I was tasked with the challenge of creating a fully-functional and searchable SQL database to sort and read recipes. In layman's terms, I was given a series of recipes, and I had to make a website that displayed them all programatically. The site I ended up designing was Æat, a database of recipes with a heart.</p>
                    <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Background:</p>

                    <li>Æat, a searchable database of recipes utilizing <i>at least</i> SQL and PHP.</li>
                    <li>Pupose - An introductory project designed to help me understand SQL and PHP.</li>
                    <li>Timeline - 10 Weeks, Apr 03 2019 - Jun 14 2019</li>
                    <li>Budget - 1 Term's Tuition.</li>

                    <p>Problem:</p>

                    <li>The client had a series of recipes they needed to be able to search through on a web platform.</li>

                    <p>Goals:</p>

                    <li>Initialize and maintain a working SQL database.</li>
                    <li>Gain a complex understanding of PHP and SQL.</li>
                    <li>Explore languages that work in conjunction with database, such as AJAX.</li>

                    <p>This was a solo project, so I ended up taking on all the roles of the project. I mainly wanted to complete the project with a higher understanding of PHP and SQL, but I also wanted to explore topics in these languages not discussed or taught to me in class. To further explore these languages, throughout the term I researched special topics in PHP, such as connecting it to AJAX, uploading files with the $_FILES tag, and filtering a database using given keywords and search parameters.</p>

                        <div class="q-box d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center"><img
                                src="assets/images/quote.png" alt=""></div>
                        <div class="bbg media-body">
                            <h5 class="mb-0">I also wanted to explore topics not discussed or taught to me in class.</h5>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
                    <div class="card ar-img-over">
                        <img class="card-img" src="assets/images/timelapse.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>My initial focus was on creating a color scheme that fit the project. I initially fiddled around with some vibrant reds and yellows, trying to give my site a brash aesthetic. I focused internally on how I wanted my site to make the user feel, and the mood I wanted to portray was not bold and in-your-face, but calming and relaxing. I wanted to make a website that people could go to after a long day of work, search up an easy, healthy recipe to make, have a relaxing time cooking, and not stay serene. Because I wanted my design to have a calming aesthetic, I ended up going with Royal Blue for the primary color, and Snow as the accent color.</p>
                    <p>In the beginning, I used Helvetica for all items on the website. I saw this as a classic, recognizable, and readible font that would shorten load times because I would not have to load in any external fonts files. As time went on, though, I began to realize that well it is universally recognizable, it did not give off the aesthetic that I was going for. I searched through Google Fonts, and eventually decided on Montserrat as the primary font for headers and titles, and Railway as the description font for all descriptive text. These fonts pair amazingly well, are both easily readible, and have a light feel, relaxing the user more than Helvetica.</p>
                    <div class="card ar-img-over">
                        <img class="card-img" src="assets/images/timelapse_recipe.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>While I did not focus too much on the sharp corners of the images in the early prototyping phases, I later on discovered that these did not mesh well with the relaxing aesthetic I was striving for. To remove some of the sharpness of the design, I opted for a rounded-corner card style. During initial user testing, users got confused at which recipe name and description linked with which recipe image as they continued scrolling through any recipe's page. The switch to a card style also created a further visual distinction for which information pertained to which image. This removed that confusion for the users, while also matching with the visual aesthetic I had hoped to obtain.</p>
                    <p>Going in to this project, I understood that a lot of its difficulty came from its techinical challenge, rather than design. Since I have years of experience coding, I find it easier to prototype initial designs in code, so all my sketches and wireframes were forgone for simple, fast iteration prototypes. By starting later on in the prototyping phase, I sacrificed some research in the design of my website to instead ensure that I completed the project by the deadline, and learned from the experience.</p>
                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <div class="card ar-img-over">
                        <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/342254958" width="100%" height="337" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>Æat features a dynamically scaling interface that works on all devices and any database size. Whether given 40 recipes or 400 recipes, Æat's backend can support it all with a marginal difference in load times. Under the admin panel, users can upload their own recipes with their own custom images, and Æat will automatically rename images and reformat text to coincide with the conventions of Æat's backend, all without forcing any extra formatting for the user! Everything from the backend to the frontend design is carefully crafted to make the user feel at rest.</p>
                    <p>So go on, go home...</p>

                    <h2>The Results</h2>
                    <div class="card ar-img-over">
                        <img class="card-img" src="assets/images/code_snippet.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>Though the project was an overall success, there were a few main  problems I encounted along the way. I ended up trying to create a backend content management system to allow uses to edit existing recipes and add new ones. Though this was an extra goal I only began working on after completing the initial project, I was not able to complete it to a point I would be satisfied with on time. While adding a new recipe was completely fleshed out and working by the client's deadline, I spent all night before the client's due date to make editing an existing recipe work, but I did not get that work flow completed until an hour after I sent my work to the client.</p>
                    <p>Through this project, I learned how to code in PHP and SQL. By going for the extra CMS challenge, I definitely learned much more about these systems than I would have if I stuck with the original base work given by the client. Though they were not a complete success, because of all the new functions I now understand how to do in PHP, I do not regret going for them at all. In the future, I hope to strive for the same level of detail in my projects I gave to this one, and I hope people will enjoy my projects as much as I enjoy them!</p>
